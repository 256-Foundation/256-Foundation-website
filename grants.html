  <h3 align="center">General Fund Grants</h3>
    <p align="center">These are the initiatives supported by General Fund donations, these grants are intended to be long-term support initiatives with continued funding, not touch-and-go projects. 100% of donations made to the General Fund go to support the people working on these initiatives through grants. Combined, these grants break the entire Bitcoin mining stack free from its closed-source shackles. Starting with a standardized ~100W hashboard, the Ember One, this multi-chip hashboard lays the ground work for more powerful mining systems built with a range of ASICs from different manufacturers. Next, we added a versatile control board, the Libre Board, that can run a full Bitcoin node, communicate with a range of sensors and relays, and offers the end-user the ability to customize the compute module. Then to get the hardware components communicating with each other, we developed the mission-driven firmware, Mujina, which interfaces with the hashboards, the mining pool, the user interface, and the on-board diagnostics of the mining system. Finally, to bring it full circle, we are including a one-click deployable mining pool called Hydra Pool which features solo mining mode and PPLNS share accounting and pay out. The future is open-source.</p>
